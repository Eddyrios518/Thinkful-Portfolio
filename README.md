# Thinkful-Portfolio
    
    Practice run for active portfolio on web development for Thinkful in order to gain experience and thorough understanding on portfolio creation.
    
    Languages used for this elementary project were HTML and CSS with basic knowledge. Implemented with VSCode. 
    
    Learned to properly use VSCode with CSS and HTML qualities. Realized it is much harder than anticipated, but nothing groundbreaking. 
    
    Planning on coming back to this project and implementing new skills along with JS qualities and features.
